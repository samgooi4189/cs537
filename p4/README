Methodology
____________________________________________________________________
1) Use linked list to organize the order the requests should be handled.
FIFO - add new request to the end
SFF - the shortest would be in front of the linked list, short to long
SFF-BS - group the request based on the sffbs arg, sort the nodes within that group with the same SFF principle

2) Every worker thread/consumer always read from the head of the linked list
Correct order is already guaranteed above
